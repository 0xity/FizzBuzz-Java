# FizzBuzz
A basic training program written in Java.  
This does the following:
- Iterates through all numbers from 1 to 100
- If the number is divisible by 3, it prints the number and "Fizz!"
- If the number is divisible by 5, it prints the number and "Buzz!"
- If the number is divisible by 15, it prints the number and "FizzBuzz!"
- Otherwise, it prints the number.
